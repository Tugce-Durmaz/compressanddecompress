For compress and decompress process you need to do following

By default this code will compress and decompress data.txt but if you want to compress and decompress another file you need to set your file name in the file-compress-and-decompress.js at line of 8 

for example if your filename is test.txt then change the related line as 

const rawFile = 'test.txt';

after that run below command

node file-compress-and-decompress.js
